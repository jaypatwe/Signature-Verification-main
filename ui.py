def signature_verify(selection):
    ''' Performs signature verification and displays the anchor image alongside 
        the detections from all the documents and their corresponding cosine 
        similarity score.

        For the demo, all three phases (signature detection, cleaning and 
        verification) are performed on all the documents. The cleaned image of 
        all documents are compared with the anchor image (the signature in the 
        database corresponding to the document the user selected from the
        dropdown) to demonstrate that matching pairs give a higher cosine 
        similarity score and non-matching pairs produce a lower score.
        Ideally, the anchor image should be selected from the "Account Name" and
        "Signatory Name" returned by Vikas' module.

        For POC, the motive is to show that matching signature pairs have a 
        score close to 1 and non-matching signatures have a lower score (<0.7).
        The logic used is a simple matching with filename.

        So the index or id User Signatures are denoted by their file name.
        Eg: User1's anchor signature in media/UserSignatureSquare will be named 
        as 1.png.
        For the sake of simplicity, I have matched the name of document in
        similar logic.
        Eg: Document 1 (media/documents/1.png) contains the signature of the 
        user. 
        The the signature to be compared with is selected on the basis of 
        filename.
